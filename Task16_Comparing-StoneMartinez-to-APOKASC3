| Differences                   | (Stone-Martinez et al. 2025)                                                                                                              | (Pinsonneault et al. 2025) APOKASC-3                                                                                                   |

| Primary Aim                   | Develop a machine-learning model (normalizing flows) to infer stellar ages from abundances and stellar parameters.                        | Produce a large, uniform asteroseismic catalog with masses, radii, ages, and evolutionary states.                                       |
| Methodical Approach           | Probabilistic ML model learns the joint distribution of Teff, log g, [Fe/H], [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and age.                                     | Uses asteroseismic scaling relations, Δν corrections, Gaia luminosities, YREC stellar evolution models, and multiple seismic pipelines. |
| Age Determination             | Chemical abundances (C, N, Fe), stellar parameters, and learned distributions.                                                            | Asteroseismic mass and radius combined with stellar evolution models.                                                                   |
| Data Sources                  | APOGEE abundances; MWMM data; APOKASC and APO-K2 seismic data.                                                                            | APOGEE DR17 spectra, Gaia DR3 luminosities, Kepler asteroseismology (10 independent pipelines).                                         |
| Uncertainty (General)         | Training-set bias, poor coverage at young (<1 Gyr) and old (>8 Gyr) ages, C/N relation plateau, degeneracies in the learned distribution. | Mass loss assumptions, convective core treatment, seismic measurement errors (nmax, Δν, Teff), evolutionary-state misclassification.    |
| Typical Age Uncertainties     | ~18% for young stars; larger for >8 Gyr due to C/N plateau.                                                                               | Approximately 20–40% depending on mass and evolutionary state.                                                                          |
| Validation Methods            | Comparison to open-cluster ages (OCCAM + Cantat-Gaudin catalog).                                                                          | External checks on mass, radius, age; evolutionary-state classification using six methods; cluster and population tests.                |
| Strengths                     | Flexible probabilistic modeling; captures joint distributions; accounts for measurement density and coverage.                             | High-precision seismic measurements; robust physical modeling; anchored to absolute scales using Gaia and APOGEE.                       |
| Limitations                   | Strongly dependent on abundance-age calibration; sensitive to chemical-evolution biases; limited training coverage.                       | Model-dependent systematics in mass loss, core convection, and evolutionary tracks; seismic methods may disagree.                       |

| Similarities (only)                | Description                                                                                                           |

| Focus on Stellar Ages              | Both works aim to estimate ages of evolved stars and analyze age-related uncertainties.                               |
| Use of APOGEE / Asteroseismic Data | Each study incorporates APOGEE abundances and asteroseismic information from APOKASC or Kepler.                       |
| Model-Dependent Uncertainties      | Both acknowledge that systematic uncertainties arise from stellar models, chemical evolution, or seismic assumptions. |
| Challenges at Old Ages             | Both studies note significant uncertainty for older stars due to model or abundance degeneracies.                     |

| Specifics to Age                 | (Stone-Martinez et al. 2025)                                                                             | (Pinsonneault et al. 2025) APOKASC-3                                                                    |

| Primary Age Indicator            | Chemical abundances (especially C/N) learned via machine-learning relationships.                         | Asteroseismic mass and radius combined with stellar-evolution models.                                   |
| Main Source of Systematics       | Biases from Galactic chemical evolution; C/N–age relation dependence; abundance calibration limitations. | Mass-loss assumptions, Δν corrections, convective-core modeling, and evolutionary-state classification. |
| Age Reliability Across Range     | Accurate for young stars; reliability drops significantly for ages >8 Gyr due to C/N plateau.            | More stable across all ages but sensitive to model physics and seismic uncertainties.                   |
| Typical Age Uncertainties        | ~18% for young stars; large uncertainties at old ages (>8 Gyr).                                          | About 20–40% depending on mass and evolutionary phase.                                                  |
| Overall Age (Thoughts )          | Ages are limited by chemistry-driven degeneracies and calibration issues.                                | Ages are limited by model physics but anchored by precise seismic constraints.                          |
